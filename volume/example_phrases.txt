I can play much better now
she wears too much makeup
my bare face in the wind
batman wears a cape
I hate baking pies
lydia wants to go home
win first prize in the contest
freud wrote of the ego
I do not care if you do that
always cover all the bases
nobody cares anymore
can we play cards tonight
get rid of that immediately
I watched blazing saddles
the sum of the parts
they love to yap about nothing
peek out the window
be home before midnight
he played a pimp in that movie
I skimmed through your proposal
he was wearing a sweatshirt
no more war no more bloodshed
toss the ball around
I will meet you at noon
I want to hold your hand
the children are playing
superman never wore a mask
I listen to the tape everyday
he is shouting loudly
correct your diction immediately
seasoned golfers love the game
